# C# Behavior template

Drop the *.cs.txt file into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity\Editor\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates` or your Unity installation folder.

Delete the `Boo` script template, it's useless. The C# NonBehaviour script template is a better use in that spot. 

Restart Unity afterward to see the new menu options.
