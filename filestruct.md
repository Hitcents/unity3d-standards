File Structure Standards
==============

Unity3D projects should have the following file structure:

```
Assets /
  Animations
  Art /
    Materials
  Editor
  Fonts
  Models
  Music
  Physic Materials
  Prefabs /
    * More folders here for organization *
  Scenes
  Sounds
  Scripts /
    * More folders here for organization *
  Shaders 
  Terrains
```
  
Additional folders may be in here depending on the project, such as `NGUI` or `Standard Assets`.

If you have files in the wrong folder, happy Slapsgiving.
