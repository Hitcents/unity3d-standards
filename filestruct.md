File Structure Standards
==============

Unity3D projects should have the following file structure:

```
Assets /
  Animations
  Art
  Editor
  Models
  Music
  Prefabs
  Scenes
  Sounds
  Scripts
```
  
Additional folders may be in here depending on the project, such as `NGUI`.

If you have files in the wrong folder, happy Slapsgiving.
