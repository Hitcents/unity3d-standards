#Game Objects

* *Always* name your game objects to something meaningful
* If you have a large set of objects in a scene, nest them into an empty game object to act as a folder. Name the folder something meaningful.
* At the uppermost level of a scene, group objects in folder named `[UI]` or `[Enemies]`. Pick names that work well for your game. The brackets will make it so new things added to a scene will pop to the bottom, where you can easily drag it to the appropriate folder.
